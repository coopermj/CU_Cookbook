        It's the moment you've all been waiting for, it's finally here, the Chuck's cookbook!
        No longer do you have to wait in line at Habanero for the prospect of good food,
        now you can just cook it yourself with the simple recipes included in this app.
        Here for Saturday night dinner or over break? No need to fear, the Churck's cookbook is here to save you!
        <br><br>
        The Chuck's Survival Guide was created by 2017 Cedarville graduate, Joey Morin because
        he was tired of people complaining there should be a place for chuck's recipes, but then
        never doing anything about it, so he wrote the recipes and programmed this app for everyone to enjoy!
