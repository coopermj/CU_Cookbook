    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <p class="ingredients">
      2 slices of ham <br>
      1 scoop of sausage<br>
      1 small bowl of eggs<br>
      2 small tong grabs of onions<br>
      2 small tong grabs of green peppers<br>
      1 small tong grab of spinach<br>
      1 small cup of cheese (half mozzarella, half shredded)
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <p class="directions" style="text-align: left">
      1)	Get ham first, then dice up the ham into small pieces (0.5"x0.5" is fine) while there is room on the plate, then gather the rest of the ingredients<br><br>
      2)	Squeeze some oil onto the grill, then put ham, sausage, onions, peppers and spinach on the grill and flatten/spread out to be sure that everything is cooking<br><br>
      3)	Squeeze more oil onto the grill and pour eggs. Be sure to keep the eggs from running too far from a concentrated rectangular pattern.<br><br>
      4)	Mix the ingredients together while the eggs are cooking. Add a few shakes of Cajun seasoning for extra flavor!<br><br>
      5)	Be sure to slide the spatula under the eggs every once in a while so that the eggs don't get stuck to the grill.<br><br>
      6)	Once the eggs have begun to congeal on the top, take the bowl of cheese and spread out evenly over eggs<br><br>
      7)	Once the cheese has begun to melt, scoop up the ham, sausage, etc., and put in a line on the right side of the eggs. Sprinkle a few shakes of salt and pepper over everything. Add a drizzle of salsa if you want a little extra spice and flavor!<br><br>
      8a) Trifold - Slide the spatula under the eggs on the right side, and flip so the half of the omelet is folded. Then slide the spatula under the newly folded section and flip again so that the omelet is totally folded<br><br>
      		OR<br><br>
      8b) Bifold - Slide the spatula under the eggs on the right side and flip completely over so the omelet is folded in half<br><br>
      9)	Take your omelet off the grill and put on a blue plate<br><br>
      10)	Clean the grill for the next person to use<br><br>
      11)	Enjoy!
