    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <p class="ingredients">
      3 slices of ham<br>
      4 scoops of egg (small bowl about 2/3 full)<br>
      2 slices of cheese (cheddar or provolone)<br>
      1 bagel (plain, multigrain, or everything are the best)
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <p class="directions" style="text-align: left">
      1)	Choose a bagel and toast it until golden (plain or everything bagel is best)<br><br>
      2)	Squeeze oil onto the grill, then pour eggs onto the grill and shape to form a skinny rectangle <br><br>
      3)	Slap that ham on the grill and drizzle a little honey on it<br><br>
      4)	Once the eggs have congealed enough, cut them into three equal sections and flip them over to be sure that both sides are cooked<br><br>
      5)	Flip ham so it doesn't burn<br><br>
      6)	Lightly salt & pepper both the eggs and the ham<br><br>
      7)	Once both sides of the eggs are sufficiently cooked stack two of the egg sections together and then stack the ham on top of that.<br><br>
      8)	Place cheese on top of ham and egg stack, then place the last egg section on the very top<br><br>
      9)	Remove the stack from the grill and place on your toasted bagel which should be on a Blue plate, because food this good deserves the best.<br><br>
      10)	Clean the grill for the next person to use<br><br>
      11)	Enjoy!
