      2)	Squeeze some oil on the grill and put chicken and veggies (onions, green peppers, broccoli) on separately.<br><br>
      3)	While on the grill, dice up the veggies into small pieces and be sure to keep mixing the veggies and chicken separately so everything cooks.<br><br>
      4)	Pour the eggs onto the grill beside the chicken and veggies, but do not mix yet.<br><br>
      5)	While the eggs cook, mix the veggies and the chicken together and sprinkle half the stir fry seasoning on top. Make sure you mix to make sure everything is seasoned.<br><br>
      6)	Once the eggs are cooked, chop them into pieces using the spatula and mix into the chicken and veggies.<br><br>
      7)	Dump the rice onto the grill and mix together with everything else. Sprinkle the rest of the stir fry seasoning in with everything and mix.<br><br>
      8)	Squeeze soy sauce onto everything until the rice turns a light brown in color. Mix.<br><br>
      9)	Drizzle a little bit of honey on top of everything, sprinkle a little salt and pepper and then stir and mix everything.<br><br>
